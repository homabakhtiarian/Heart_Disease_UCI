# Heart Disease

## Summary

What we are going to do, is to use logistic regression to predict if a patient has this heart disease or not. 

Diagnosis: The diagnosis of heart disease is done on a combination of clinical signs and test results. 
The types of tests run will be chosen on the basis of what the physician thinks is going on, ranging from electrocardiograms and cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, to blood tests and exercise stress tests.

Looking at information of heart disease risk factors led us to the following: high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking. 
According to another source, the major factors that can't be changed are: increasing age, male gender and heredity. 
Note that thalassemia, one of the variables in this dataset, is heredity. Major factors that can be modified are: Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes. 
Other factors include stress, alcohol and poor diet/nutrition.
